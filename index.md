# Ashley Burr's Log for English 507
## 27 January 2015:
John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester, was never known for his spiritual or moral values. A sinner by trade, the majority of his poems left religion to the religious. However, in his poem “To The Postboy”, Rochester takes off his mask of drink and women and reveals a concern for his own mortality. With every line of the poem he slowly tears away at his libertine persona and exposes vulnerability and insecurity. It is speculated that Rochester converted to Christianity on his deathbed, but in reviewing this particular poem we see hints that perhaps religion was not a last minute choice for him, but instead a lengthier, more contemplated decision and this is something worthy of investigation. Through Rochester as an individual and the libertine persona as a whole, I ask the question of whether it possible to be both religious and a libertine?
	
A possible route to further this question through new media could be searching for key terms in other principal works of Rochester that might illuminate some of his views on spirituality, accompanying the piece with either audio or video aids. Creating new links between new media and computation can help address this question in a new way through quantitative searching of terms, seeing patterns that normally would go unnoticed. New media also allows creation for user interaction, which can produce exciting arguments that can provide evidence in different forms such as audio and video. 
New media can help me develop speculations on larger quantities of literature through scanning through vast sums of material quickly, searching for key terms and patterns.

I would like to make the argument using a long form, media-rich narrative because it would allow me to accompany my reading of the poem with interactive elements, such as discussing the significance of the meter and rhyme through moving the users mouse to parts of the poem. 

Some of the possible ingredients for my argument are Scalar, CSS and Active Markdown. The idea of making my reading of a poem more accessible to a wider audience is what principally influenced my decision concerning format. Creating an interactive layout can be intriguing to less academic audiences who tend to become bored of reading the standard critical essay. I am interested in education and am always looking for ways to make younger people excited about literature and I believe an interactive format aids in achieving that.

I am convinced by Galloway’s observation that hermeneutic interpretation and imminent iridescence are beginning to fade in the shadow of the network, yet I disagree that they will ever completely disappear. The network has become a necessity because of the exponentially growing amount of information available. To properly assess information in a specific field the use of machines becomes an asset in organizing all of the applicable knowledge. I do however see a danger in relying too heavily on networks and losing the contextual intelligence that can be applied when using hermeneutics. Hermeneutics encourages alternative thinking that is outside the realm of standard vernacular reasoning and because of this it has the capability to provide concepts and ideas that a standard network may not have considered. Immanence is also a valuable form because it provides possibilities for the individual to respond viscerally, which can lead to an unhindered truth due to the thinker having no time to edit their reaction. 

Should Galloway’s claims occur, scholarship would likely continue in a direction of placing extreme value on accuracy and less on creativity. The arts in education are already met with skepticism due to the lack of definite “right” and “wrong” concepts. Having a solely network based society pushes the arts towards more unambiguous views, losing the independent immersive experience that makes literature what it is. 

Galloway seems to be lamenting that this is the direction society is moving. When Galloway closes his argument discussing Aphrodite as representing the individual who stays in the “middle” (67-8) he contemplates how each part of the body is essential to the whole, which is why I would argue that Galloway would not advocate for a completely networked world. Galloway appears to endorse a need for an efficient balance of hermeneutics, immanence and networks, not a singular dominant form.
