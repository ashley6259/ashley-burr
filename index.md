# Ashley Burr's Log for English 507

## 20 January 2015:
I am convinced by Galloway’s observation that hermeneutic interpretation and imminent iridescence are beginning to fade in the shadow of the network, yet I disagree that they will ever completely disappear. The network has become a necessity because of the exponentially growing amount of information available. To properly assess information in a specific field the use of machines becomes an asset in organizing all of the applicable knowledge. I do however see a danger in relying too heavily on networks and losing the contextual intelligence that can be applied when using hermeneutics. Hermeneutics encourages alternative thinking that is outside the realm of standard vernacular reasoning and because of this it has the capability to provide concepts and ideas that a standard network may not have considered. Immanence is also a valuable form because it provides possibilities for the individual to respond viscerally, which can lead to an unhindered truth due to the thinker having no time to edit their reaction. 

Should Galloway’s claims occur, scholarship would likely continue in a direction of placing extreme value on accuracy and less on creativity. The arts in education are already met with skepticism due to the lack of definite “right” and “wrong” concepts. Having a solely network based society pushes the arts towards more unambiguous views, losing the independent immersive experience that makes literature what it is. 

Galloway seems to be lamenting that this is the direction society is moving. When Galloway closes his argument discussing Aphrodite as representing the individual who stays in the “middle” (67-8) he contemplates how each part of the body is essential to the whole, which is why I would argue that Galloway would not advocate for a completely networked world. Galloway appears to endorse a need for an efficient balance of hermeneutics, immanence and networks, not a singular dominant form.
