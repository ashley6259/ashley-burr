Revised Thought Piece
######(Text in bold has been revised)

John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester, was never known for his spiritual or moral values. A sinner by trade, the majority of his poems left religion to the religious. However, in his poem “To The Postboy”, Rochester takes off his mask of drink and women and reveals a concern for his own mortality. With every line of the poem he slowly tears away at his libertine persona and exposes vulnerability and insecurity. It is speculated that Rochester converted to Christianity on his deathbed, but in reviewing this particular poem we see hints that perhaps religion was not a last minute choice for him, but instead a lengthier, more contemplated decision and this is something worthy of investigation. Through Rochester’s 
#####poem I will juxtapose a spectrum of versions using deformance to see the range from religious to libertine.
	
#####Through new media I will create juxtaposed version of the poem with systematic rule/rules that I will develop. These rules will be based on comparisons and patterns seen in other poetry of the period (libertine and religious poetry). Patterns I might use include word choice, rhyme, style and form. I will attempt to identify which of the deformed poems would be most believable as a Rochester poem. I will also provide all of the poems I used to construct my deformation criteria. 

Some of the possible ingredients for my argument

 Markdown. The idea of making my reading of a poem more accessible to a wider audience is what principally influenced my decision concerning format.

##Ashley's Reviews on Thought Pieces:

###1) Adam Kneeland
Make sure you have a direct idea of where your argument is going and keeping that point defined. Because you are interested in The Knight’s Tale, The Wife Bath and a few other tales you could focus on a few different tales making different points each. You can show how when the text escapes or shifts in meaning. It would be interesting to make the game into an applicable, interactive source, I think you should focus on the gaming aspect..
Create a game with an unstated argument and then give your blatant argument afterwards
Satisfy some kind of achievement, giving the user choices. 
Oculus rift has a horror game that is purely interaction based not points based.



###2) Danielle Morgan
You could give your projecting perspective, what you can see that is best described through image. Different readings, audio recordings, can be used to represent different perspectives. You can ask what is it like to be read to? You provide a monotone reading and then an audio of your individual interpretation represented through your voice. You could then encourage people to post their own audio recordings as well. You can see and hear a contrast and for kids it is exciting. 

Your design could be very key, you have to make some very specific and thought-out choices in the way you present your project. You could give your reader choices of perspective (dark, exciting, beautiful, etc…) and they will see the poem through that design perspective. Engulf the audience with the way a text can be read differently as you read.

With all the exciting design aspects be sure you also stick to your original argument and make the whole project well rounded leaving your audience thinking about your original thesis. 



###3) Katherine Goertz
Choose your own adventure could be an exciting framework. You can place your audience in different perspectives and dependent on those perspectives they will be given limited content on the situation
How would you get people to realize the alternate perspectives and see them?
Thinking about how all of history is written from a certain perspective. 
Different evidence from the same event leads users to different conclusions.
Moving all the events apart and then your interpretation may change of the text, taking away context.
Maybe have a room and all the events as objects in a room and as you click on various items you get little clues what the object is related to.
Allowing users to arrange a timeline could be another exciting attribute
Make sure you have a closing takeaway idea that you want people to have when they walk away and incorporate this idea the whole way through.

You could use a poll to see how people statistically people are perceiving or a forum for them to give thoughts. Assembling different perspectives from your audience would create a sense of community and reflection, however, I wouldn’t allow users to comment or see other’s comments until they are done using everything else you provide first.

However, in his poem “To The Postboy”, Rochester takes off his mask of drink and women and reveals a concern for his own mortality. With every line of the poem he slowly tears away at his libertine persona and exposes vulnerability and insecurity. It is speculated that Rochester converted to Christianity on his deathbed, but in reviewing this particular poem we see hints that perhaps religion was not a last minute choice for him, but instead a lengthier, more contemplated decision and this is something worthy of investigation. Through Rochester as an individual and the libertine persona as a whole, I ask the question of whether it possible to be both religious and a libertine?
	
A possible route to further this question through new media could be searching for key terms in other principal works of Rochester that might illuminate some of his views on spirituality, accompanying the piece with either audio or video aids. Creating new links between new media and computation can help address this question in a new way through quantitative searching of terms, seeing patterns that normally would go unnoticed. New media also allows creation for user interaction, which can produce exciting arguments that can provide evidence in different forms such as audio and video. 
New media can help me develop speculations on larger quantities of literature through scanning through vast sums of material quickly, searching for key terms and patterns.

I would like to make the argument using a long form, media-rich narrative because it would allow me to accompany my reading of the poem with interactive elements, such as discussing the significance of the meter and rhyme through moving the users mouse to parts of the poem. 

Some of the possible ingredients for my argument are Scalar, CSS and Active Markdown. The idea of making my reading of a poem more accessible to a wider audience is what principally influenced my decision concerning format. Creating an interactive layout can be intriguing to less academic audiences who tend to become bored of reading the standard critical essay. I am interested in education and am always looking for ways to make younger people excited about literature and I believe an interactive format aids in achieving that.

## 20 January 2015:
I am convinced by Galloway’s observation that hermeneutic interpretation and imminent iridescence are beginning to fade in the shadow of the network, yet I disagree that they will ever completely disappear. The network has become a necessity because of the exponentially growing amount of information available. To properly assess information in a specific field the use of machines becomes an asset in organizing all of the applicable knowledge. I do however see a danger in relying too heavily on networks and losing the contextual intelligence that can be applied when using hermeneutics. Hermeneutics encourages alternative thinking that is outside the realm of standard vernacular reasoning and because of this it has the capability to provide concepts and ideas that a standard network may not have considered. Immanence is also a valuable form because it provides possibilities for the individual to respond viscerally, which can lead to an unhindered truth due to the thinker having no time to edit their reaction. 

Should Galloway’s claims occur, scholarship would likely continue in a direction of placing extreme value on accuracy and less on creativity. The arts in education are already met with skepticism due to the lack of definite “right” and “wrong” concepts. Having a solely network based society pushes the arts towards more unambiguous views, losing the independent immersive experience that makes literature what it is. 

Galloway seems to be lamenting that this is the direction society is moving. When Galloway closes his argument discussing Aphrodite as representing the individual who stays in the “middle” (67-8) he contemplates how each part of the body is essential to the whole, which is why I would argue that Galloway would not advocate for a completely networked world. Galloway appears to endorse a need for an efficient balance of hermeneutics, immanence and networks, not a singular dominant form.
