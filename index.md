###Secondary Sources 

####Campion, Peter. "Rochester's Honesty." New Criterion 23.8 (2005): 17-20. Art Source. Web. 5 Feb. 2015.
	
Campion looks at Rochester as a “performer of selfhood” (18). Specifically using “To the Postboy” as an example of Rochester unmasking himself and then retreating, hiding behind his libertine persona.

Campion’s insight on “To the Postboy” adds to my argument that there are multiple faces to Rochester. Specifically, this article looks at Rochester’s many faces as negotiations within himself, and I will center this view of an unmasking taking place within “To the Postboy”.

####Cynthia Richards. "Wit at War: The Poetry of John Wilmot and the Trauma of War." Eighteenth-Century Fiction 27.1 (2014): 25-54. Project MUSE. Web. 5 Feb. 2015

Richards is concerned with the “fragmented self” (30) when looking at Rochester’s poetry through trauma narrative. Additionally, Richards argues that Rochester’s uniqueness is his ability to say what others cannot and this wittiness is “essential even as we acknowledge his traumatic wounds” (32).

Richards’ reflections on two kinds of selves within Rochester’s poetry are very applicable to the two layers I am seeing in Rochester’s “To the Postboy”. The trauma discussed is related to the events that led up to Rochester’s poem. Richards also points out a notable spiritual agreement between Rochester and a friend, promising one another to meet each other in the afterlife, a promise that has repercussions on the way we view Rochester’s spiritual beliefs. 

####Eyers, Tom. "The Perils of the "Digital Humanities": New Positivisms and the Fate of Literary Theory." Postmodern Culture 23.2 (2013). Project MUSE. Web. 14 Feb. 2015.

Eyers illuminates “what an alternative, progressive trajectory in literary analysis might look like” (2). Appraises methodologies such as Franco Moretti’s use of distant reading and a reaction from Prendergast who largely agrees with Moretti’s views except for his refusal to go further in his argument once it has been reduced to purely consuming through a singular model. Dismisses deformative criticism as somewhat redundant, claiming it merely confirms what others have already said.

The part of this article that is most helpful for my argument with computers is Eyers discussion of Stephen Ramsay’s “Reading Machines” and his critical views of deformation as an analysis tool. Eyers remarks that deformation usually only confirms what critiques have already said, making it redundant. I completely disagree with this reading and would touch on this fact in my argument, that the very confirmation of what other critiques have been saying is evidence of deformance’s success as a critical approach. 

####Fisher, Nicholas. "'I Abhorr What I Soe Long Lov'd': An Exploration Of Rochester's 'Death Bed Repentance'." Seventeenth Century 25.2 (2010): 323-349. Art Source. Web. 5 Feb. 2015.

Fisher attempts to appraise whether Rochester’s deathbed conversion was sincere, analyzing contextual evidence and Rochester’s literary works. A principal claim is that Rochester’s religious decision stems from a search for a stability and truth that he never found in life.

This article is extremely integral to the argument I am making, it provides both evidence for and against Rochester’s sincerity in his deathbed conversion. It leads me to realize the substantial amount of religious moments that have often go unnoticed in Rochester’s life and I will integrate some of this evidence into my piece. 

####Gill, James E. "The Fragmented Self In Three Of Rochester's Poems." Modern Language Quarterly 49.1 (1988): 19. Professional Development Collection. Web. 5 Feb. 2015.

Gill claims that Rochester’s poems have two distinctly different sets of values and that “Rochester’s best poems ‘employ paradoxes’” (21), implementing conflicting subtexts. Claims that readers must understand both the historical context and the “intellectual context in which readers perform” (23).
	
The idea of “Fragmented Self” applies both to the speaker of the poem and the reader. This article will be used as a way of understanding readership and the contradictions that occur when presented with a poem by Rochester.

####Hoover, David L. "Text-Alteration As An Interpretive Teaching Strategy: The Case Of ‘The Snow Man.’" Style 42.4 (2008): 470-485. Academic Search Complete. Web. 14 Feb. 2015.
	
Hoover argues that text-alteration is one “of the best ways to understand how a texts works” (470). The article demonstrates how through altering a text you can show students the relationships between text, reader, and interpretation. Demonstrates that even minor changes to a poem have distinct interpretive repercussions. Hoover works through different forms of text-alteration that achieve various effects.

Hoover’s article demonstrates many uses of text-alteration that provide examples for me to base my own deformation on. The claim that to give an alteration purpose you must have an argument already in mind helps outline how I should be creating my rules for deformance.

####Mackie, Erin. "Boys Will be Boys: Masculinity, Criminality, and the Restoration Rake."The Eighteenth Century 46.2 (2005): 129-49. JSTOR. Web. 5 Feb. 2015.

Mackie discuses the origins of the rake figure, and postulates that it derives from “fantasies of masculinity” (130). Claims that the rake is a key figure associated with violence.

This article will be used as a part of my basis for creating my rules for deforming “To the Postboy”. The libertine rake as a figure and genre is something I will attempt to heighten in some of the deformed versions. Mackie digs into the persona of rakes and explains how they appear above the law and as Rochester describes a “peerless peer” (130).
	
####McGann, Jerome. "Dialogue and Interpretation at the Interface of Man and Machine: Reflections on Textuality and a Proposal for an Experiment in Machine Reading." Computers and the Humanities 36.1 (2002): 95-107. ProQuest. Web. 14 Feb. 2015.

McGann explores “new approaches to computerized text analysis” (95) identifying a need for texts to be in forms compatible with digital analysis. With a focus on works by Dante, McGann suggests that the notes Dante provides between many parts of his poems create a division that changes the poem itself. McGann goes on to discuss the significance of form and Laws of Form by G. Spencer Brown who states that every text “turns reflexively back upon itself” (103). Concluding that deforming texts leads to new areas of inquiry and inspires new questions for how we can use computers to learn sets of rules and apply them to a text.

McGann points out how Dante’s notes in his poetry creates a map that can provoke readers to search for meaning. My ‘map’ will be the changes I make to Rochester’s poem to provoke readers to ask questions, like they would with Dante’s notes, contemplating what these deviations do to the poem. Like McGann suggests, a text is a “reflection of and on itself, an analysis of itself” (99).

####Samuels, Lisa, and Jerome McGann. "Deformance and Interpretation." New Literary History 30.1, Poetry & Poetics (1999): 25-56. JSTOR. Web. 15 Feb. 2015.

Samuels and McGann discuss how to “release or expose the poem’s possibilities of meaning?” (28) and answer this question through deformation. Describes four types of deformative critique: reordered, isolating, altering and adding. Claims that when you change the poem it changes the way it functions and you can then see a different side of the piece, which can provoke new questions.

This article is the basis of my critical formula in arguing with computers. I am hoping to use all four of the deformative techniques and use that deformation to question why it does or does not work as a piece of Rochester’s poetry. Ultimately, trying to unravel how religious or libertine “To the Postboy” can become before it no longer bears a resemblance to a piece written by Rochester.

####Vanhaesebrouck, Karel and Dehert, Pol. "Introduction: Libertine Bodies or the Politics of Baroque Corporeality." Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies 12.2 (2012): 1-11. Project MUSE. Web. 5 Feb. 2015.

Vanhaesebrouck is calling for a return to the understanding of libertinism form the seventeenth and eighteenth century, “inherently experimental nature, its performative urgency that made individuals believe that they could rethink their world and their position as individuals within that world” (3). Using Rochester as his basis Vanhaesebrouck claims a libertine is both absorbed in the performative body and “is at the same time burlesque, pornographic, satirical, and political” (5).

My argument will incorporate Vanhaesebrouck’s discussion of the division and fluctuation in Rochester’s work, that he is constantly searching for answers and show this confliction in his writing, which is what I will demonstrate in “To the Postboy”.

Revised Thought Piece
######(Text in bold has been revised)

John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester, was never known for his spiritual or moral values. A sinner by trade, the majority of his poems left religion to the religious. However, in his poem “To The Postboy”, Rochester takes off his mask of drink and women and reveals a concern for his own mortality. With every line of the poem he slowly tears away at his libertine persona and exposes vulnerability and insecurity. It is speculated that Rochester converted to Christianity on his deathbed, but in reviewing this particular poem we see hints that perhaps religion was not a last minute choice for him, but instead a lengthier, more contemplated decision and this is something worthy of investigation. Through Rochester’s 
#####poem I will juxtapose a spectrum of versions using deformance to see a range from religious to libertine.
	
#####Through new media I will create different versions of the poem with systematic rules that I will develop. These rules will be based on comparisons and patterns seen in other poetry of the period (libertine and religious poetry). Patterns I might use include word choice, rhyme, style and form. I will attempt to identify which of the deformed poems would be most believable as a Rochester poem. I will also provide all of the poems I used to construct my deformation criteria. 

Some of the possible ingredients for my argument 
#####HTML
 Markdown. The idea of making my reading of a poem more accessible to a wider audience is what principally influenced my decision concerning format.

##Ashley's Reviews on Thought Pieces:

###1) Adam Kneeland
Make sure you have a direct idea of where your argument is going and keeping that point defined. Because you are interested in The Knight’s Tale, The Wife Bath and a few other tales you could focus on a few different tales making different points each. You can show how when the text escapes or shifts in meaning. It would be interesting to make the game into an applicable, interactive source, I think you should focus on the gaming aspect..
Create a game with an unstated argument and then give your blatant argument afterwards
Satisfy some kind of achievement, giving the user choices. 
Oculus rift has a horror game that is purely interaction based not points based.



###2) Danielle Morgan
You could give your projecting perspective, what you can see that is best described through image. Different readings, audio recordings, can be used to represent different perspectives. You can ask what is it like to be read to? You provide a monotone reading and then an audio of your individual interpretation represented through your voice. You could then encourage people to post their own audio recordings as well. You can see and hear a contrast and for kids it is exciting. 

Your design could be very key, you have to make some very specific and thought-out choices in the way you present your project. You could give your reader choices of perspective (dark, exciting, beautiful, etc…) and they will see the poem through that design perspective. Engulf the audience with the way a text can be read differently as you read.

With all the exciting design aspects be sure you also stick to your original argument and make the whole project well rounded leaving your audience thinking about your original thesis. 



###3) Katherine Goertz
Choose your own adventure could be an exciting framework. You can place your audience in different perspectives and dependent on those perspectives they will be given limited content on the situation
How would you get people to realize the alternate perspectives and see them?
Thinking about how all of history is written from a certain perspective. 
Different evidence from the same event leads users to different conclusions.
Moving all the events apart and then your interpretation may change of the text, taking away context.
Maybe have a room and all the events as objects in a room and as you click on various items you get little clues what the object is related to.
Allowing users to arrange a timeline could be another exciting attribute
Make sure you have a closing takeaway idea that you want people to have when they walk away and incorporate this idea the whole way through.

You could use a poll to see how people statistically people are perceiving or a forum for them to give thoughts. Assembling different perspectives from your audience would create a sense of community and reflection, however, I wouldn’t allow users to comment or see other’s comments until they are done using everything else you provide first. 

##Ashley's Thought Piece:

However, in his poem “To The Postboy”, Rochester takes off his mask of drink and women and reveals a concern for his own mortality.

It is speculated that Rochester converted to Christianity on his deathbed, but in reviewing this particular poem we see hints that perhaps religion was not a last minute choice for him, but instead a lengthier, more contemplated decision and this is something worthy of investigation. Through Rochester as an individual and the libertine persona as a whole, I ask the question of whether it possible to be both religious and a libertine?
	
A possible route to further this question through new media could be searching for key terms in other principal works of Rochester that might illuminate some of his views on spirituality, accompanying the piece with either audio or video aids. Creating new links between new media and computation can help address this question in a new way through quantitative searching of terms, seeing patterns that normally would go unnoticed. New media also allows creation for user interaction, which can produce exciting arguments that can provide evidence in different forms such as audio and video. 
New media can help me develop speculations on larger quantities of literature through scanning through vast sums of material quickly, searching for key terms and patterns.

I would like to make the argument using a long form, media-rich narrative because it would allow me to accompany my reading of the poem with interactive elements, such as discussing the significance of the meter and rhyme through moving the users mouse to parts of the poem. 

Some of the possible ingredients for my argument are Scalar, CSS and Active Markdown. The idea of making my reading of a poem more accessible to a wider audience is what principally influenced my decision concerning format. Creating an interactive layout can be intriguing to less academic audiences who tend to become bored of reading the standard critical essay. I am interested in education and am always looking for ways to make younger people excited about literature and I believe an interactive format aids in achieving that.

## 20 January 2015:
I am convinced by Galloway’s observation that hermeneutic interpretation and imminent iridescence are beginning to fade in the shadow of the network, yet I disagree that they will ever completely disappear. The network has become a necessity because of the exponentially growing amount of information available. To properly assess information in a specific field the use of machines becomes an asset in organizing all of the applicable knowledge. I do however see a danger in relying too heavily on networks and losing the contextual intelligence that can be applied when using hermeneutics. Hermeneutics encourages alternative thinking that is outside the realm of standard vernacular reasoning and because of this it has the capability to provide concepts and ideas that a standard network may not have considered. Immanence is also a valuable form because it provides possibilities for the individual to respond viscerally, which can lead to an unhindered truth due to the thinker having no time to edit their reaction. 

Should Galloway’s claims occur, scholarship would likely continue in a direction of placing extreme value on accuracy and less on creativity. The arts in education are already met with skepticism due to the lack of definite “right” and “wrong” concepts. Having a solely network based society pushes the arts towards more unambiguous views, losing the independent immersive experience that makes literature what it is. 

Galloway seems to be lamenting that this is the direction society is moving. When Galloway closes his argument discussing Aphrodite as representing the individual who stays in the “middle” (67-8) he contemplates how each part of the body is essential to the whole, which is why I would argue that Galloway would not advocate for a completely networked world. Galloway appears to endorse a need for an efficient balance of hermeneutics, immanence and networks, not a singular dominant form.
