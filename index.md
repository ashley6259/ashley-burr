###Panel Discussion
####Defiling the Text: Deformance and Religion in Scripture, Prose and Poetry


#####Abstract:

Typically literary criticism sees the primary text as sacred: deformance seeks to break that paradigm. When Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann wrote “Deformance and Interpretation,” they demonstrated how the deformed text can lead to a better understanding of the original, yet to highlight the work of deformance they used highly formalized poetry as examples. This panel’s three projects exhibit both the original procedures of Samuels and McGann while expanding beyond genre and technique. Ashley Burr, in her project “The Religious Libertine” uses the technique of substitution to create a spectrum of deformed versions of John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester's poem "To the Postboy" that range from spiritual to sinful. In a departure from formalized poetry, Mahsa Ebadpour's project “Some Like it Hot” uses alteration to deform the weather patterns of F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby and show how heat can kill and rain can save. Lastly, in a literal act of heresy, Matthew McBride’s “A Dark Tower” uses user gameplay to reorder the biblical verses from Genesis 11 to blur the line between user and God, the Word and code, and performance and deformance.

#####Introduction  to Deformation:

Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann wrote an article titled "Deformance and Interpretation". Their concept of Deformance is defined as changing a text in order to explore underlying meanings. There are four types of deformative methods described: reordering, isolating, altering and adding. 
They claim that when you change the text it changes the way it functions and you can then see a different side of the piece, which can provoke new questions. This method as proposed by Samuels and McGann is on poetry our group has stretched this critique to read further and use deformation for more than they originally suggested, using prose and scripture in addition to poetry.  All three of us have adapted this method in our own research in order to amplify our readings of various texts.



#####My own work with Deformation:

Samuels and McGann asks how one can “release or expose the poem’s possibilities of meaning?” (28) and they answer this question through deformation. All three of us just read aloud the final results of my deformation of John Wilmot, the second earl of Rochester's poem "To the Postboy". Mahsa read the religious version of the poem, achieved through the deformation of Repeated Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs and Nouns/Verbs with Sinful Association. Mathew read the extreme libertine version, created through the deformation of the Repeated Nouns , Verbs, Adjectives and Adverbs, and I read the original. Reading aloud helps reiterate the similarities and differences that deforming a poem produces.
Using deformative critique as my method was ideal for this poem in particular because the author is known for having a sort of fragmented self within his poetry. John Wilmot, the second earl of Rochester had a lot of scandalous poetry about sex and drink, and yet when I first read his poem "To the Postboy" in my undergrad, I sensed there was more to this poem than met the eye. Wilmot denounced and criticized religion throughout his entire life, yet, on his deathbed converted to Christianity. There are countless questions of whether he was earnest and clear minded when he made this decision. I saw religious moments in his poem and wanted to explore this through the hypothesized thesis that Rochester's conversion was not only sincere, but was something he had been considering earlier on in his life. Through deformation I needed to establish logical rules in order to change the poem to a more religious text and a more libertine text, libertine being defined as "one devoid of most moral restraints, which are seen as unnecessary or undesirable, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behaviour sanctified by the larger society" (and Rochester commonly went hand in hand with this term throughout his life in the 17th century). To have a valid deformation you have to justify the process you are using. Voyage is an extremely handy website in which you can submit any text and it will list the most commonly used words, and upon your direction, leave out certain words such as "the", "I" ,"she", etc... For my project, I found the most common words used in Rochester's libertine poetry and I also found the most commonly used terms in The 1559 Book of Common Prayer, a text Rochester grew up reading. Overall I was attempting to see if the text translated into a religious text fluidly, and, if my original thoughts on the text were right, this poem may have more of a Christian edge than originally thought. The final versions of the poem made apparent the two sides of Rochester that surface in his writing. The religious text made me look at the original poem differently, seeing it as being a confession of his sins, having an overall sense of repentance.
The amazing thing that occurs with deformation is that you don't know what you'll find. When we approach a text we approach it with our personal biases as well, Deformance is a method to escape our preconceived notions and find out if our impressions of a text are justified.

Deformation = you don't know what you'll find. 
When we approach a text we approach it with our personal biases, 
Deformance is a method to escape our preconceived notions and find out if our impressions of a text are justified.

#####Discussion questions:

Are there particular works that you could see yourself implementing deformation as method critique? Why would deformation suit that piece?
Are there ways you can think of using deformation outside of what we have done?
How do you feel about breaking the sacredness of the text by changing it? Is it damaging the text? 

#####Script
Ashley:
1. Original

Son of a whore, God damn you, can you tell
A peerless peer the readiest way to hell?
I've out-swilled Bacchus, sworn of my own make
Oaths would fright Furies, and make Pluto quake;
I've swived more whores more ways than Sodom's walls
E'er knew, or the College of Rome's Cardinals:
Witness heroic scars, Look here, ne'er go,
Cerecloths and ulcers from the top to toe;
Frighted at my own mischiefs I have fled,
And bravely left my life's defender dead;
Broke houses to break chastity, and dyed
That floor with murder which my lust denied:
Pox on it—why do I speak of these poor things;
I have blasphemed my God and libelled kings:
The readiest way to hell—come, quick, ne'er stir—
Boy: The readiest way, my Lord, 's by Rochester.

Mahasa:
Son of a Christ, Father shall you, can you tell
A peerless peer the holiest Lord to God?
I have heard Day, sworn of my own make
Oaths would fright Sonnes, and make Pluto quake;
I have said more Christs more Lords than Jesus’ walls
E'er knew, or the College of Rome's Cardinals:
Witness heroic scars, Look here, ever go,
Cerecloths and man from the top to toe;
Frighted at my own people I have fled,
And bravely left my life's defender dead;
Broke houses to break chastity, and dyed
That floor with answers which my world denied:
Life on it—why do I speak of these poor things;
I have blasphemed my Father and libelled kings:
The holiest Lord to God—come, quick, ever stir—
Boy: The holiest Lord, my Lord, 's by Rochester.

4.Mathiun:
Son of a Wit, Death damn you, can you tell
A peerless peer the wisest Time to Love?
I shall out-swill Bacchus, sworn of my own make
Oaths would fright Furies, and make Pluto quake;
I shall swive more Wits more Times than Sodom's walls
E'er knew, or the College of Rome's Cardinals:
Witness heroic scars, Look here, best go,
Cerecloths and ulcers from the top to toe;
Frighted at my own mischiefs I have fled,
And bravely left my life's defender dead;
Broke houses to break chastity, and dyed
That floor with murder which my lust denied:
Pox on it—why do I speak of these poor things;
I have blasphemed my Death and libelled kings:

### Draft Introduction

John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester, was never known for his spiritual or moral values. A sinner by trade, Rochester's poems usually shock readers with their graphic nature and pointed jabs. However, in his poem “To the Postboy”, Rochester takes off his mask of drink and women and reveals a concern for his own mortality. With every line of the poem he slowly tears away at his libertine persona and exposes vulnerability. Rochester converted to Christianity on his deathbed, a surprising choice due to his denouncing of religion in life. The sincerity of this conversion is often questioned; through close analysis of the form in particular, “To the Postboy” reveals that Rochester's turn to religion was not a last minute choice, but instead a lengthier, more contemplated decision. The first half of my argument will examine religious indicators in the language and meter of the poem. The second part of the argument will use deformance, a method coined by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann discussed in their article “"Deformance and Interpretation”, that works towards exposing the various layers of a text. Deformative critique is defined as either reordering, isolating, altering, or adding to a text, and through these changes the way the text is functioning is altered and therefore reveals the way the original text operates. By using deformation on Rochester’s “To the Postboy” to create a spectrum of texts from more religious to more libertine, the layers of this poem become clearer and re-iterate that Rochester felt great guilt for his sins. Ultimately, the multiple methods used to understand the pieces of fragmented self in “To the Postboy” demonstrate that Rochester had been contemplating a religious conversion far before his death in 1680.

###My Argument:
John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester, projects a distinct duality of self within his poetry that both intersect and hide beneath one another. In particular, his poem “To the Postboy” demonstrates an inner conflict within the speaker (the speaker being specifically identified as Rochester). This text was not only easily and believably turned into a religious text through deformation, but it additionally resembles a repentance text. Due to the nature of the deformed versions of the poem, and the way in which these deformed poems illuminate the repentance in the original, it seems evident that Rochester’s remorse had been building. In conclusion, this adds to the argument the Rochester was both earnest and coherent in his choice to convert to Christianity on his deathbed in 1680, and furthermore that this had been a decision that Rochester had been contemplating throughout his  life.

My essay will be published and discoverable. 

My data will be provided.

###A Libertine’s Faith: Using Deformation to Release the Meaning of John Wilmot’s “To the Postboy”

John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester, was never known for his spiritual or moral values. A sinner by trade, Rochester's poems usually shock readers with their graphic nature and pointed jabs. However, in his poem “To the Postboy”, Rochester takes off his mask of drink and women and reveals a concern for his own mortality. With every line of the poem he slowly tears away at his libertine persona and exposes vulnerability. Rochester converted to Christianity on his deathbed, a surprising choice due to his denouncing of religion in life. The sincerity of his conversion is often questioned, in reviewing this particular poem we see hints that perhaps religion was not a last minute choice, but instead a lengthier, more contemplated decision. Based on Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s rules for deformance and interpretation, I will deform Rochester’s “To the Postboy” on a scale of more religious to more libertine. I will then assess how believable it would be that Rochester wrote each deformed poem, and what the varying degrees of believability say about “ To the Postboy”.

There are two sets of rules that will be implemented for my deformation. To deform the poem to a more libertine extreme the most used verbs and nouns from seven poems by Rochester have been assembled using Voyant (Sinclair). These poems have been classified as “Libertine Lyrics and Shorter Satires”, this classification is based on a structure created by Harold Love for his definitive edition of The Works of John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester (1999).
The second set of rules have been implemented for the religious deformation of “To the Postboy” by taking the most frequently used verbs and nouns in The 1559 Book of Common Prayer (Booty). The reason for the use of this specific text is due to Nicholas Fisher’s research that concludes that Rochester, “in addition to absorbing religious thought patterns and turns of phrase through the practice of his mother, the regular and frequent exposure of Rochester as a child to the Bible and The Booke of Common Prayer of Queen Elizabeth undoubtedly provided him with a frame of reference and a vocabulary that he would continue to draw on as an adult” (Fisher 329).

Ultimately, I hope to assess which deformed versions could most reasonably pass as a poem by Rochester. My working thesis will be that because “To the Postboy” can be easily and believably turned into a religious text Rochester had likely been contemplating a religious conversion far before his death in 1680. The deformed poems demonstrate the two very different legitimate sides to Rochester, the libertine and the religious.

My essay will provide more evidence in the question of Rochester’s earnestness and coherence in his choice to convert to Christianity on his deathbed. The essay will not, however, concretely prove Rochester’s sincerity in his conversion, but merely will provide more evidence of his religious contemplations.

I am still unsure of how to deform the words of “To the Postboy”. I have my rules but do not know how to progressively change the poem more and more? Should I slowly add more changes? Or perhaps more intense words?

This essay is intended for the Journal Restoration: Studies in English Literary Culture, 1660-1700.

Campion looks at Rochester as a “performer of selfhood” (18). Specifically using “To the Postboy” as an example of Rochester unmasking himself and then retreating, hiding behind his libertine persona.

Campion’s insight on “To the Postboy” adds to my argument that there are multiple faces to Rochester. Specifically, this article looks at Rochester’s many faces as negotiations within himself, and I will center this view of an unmasking taking place within “To the Postboy”.

####Cynthia Richards. "Wit at War: The Poetry of John Wilmot and the Trauma of War." Eighteenth-Century Fiction 27.1 (2014): 25-54. Project MUSE. Web. 5 Feb. 2015

Richards is concerned with the “fragmented self” (30) when looking at Rochester’s poetry through trauma narrative. Additionally, Richards argues that Rochester’s uniqueness is his ability to say what others cannot and this wittiness is “essential even as we acknowledge his traumatic wounds” (32).

Richards’ reflections on two kinds of selves within Rochester’s poetry are very applicable to the two layers I am seeing in Rochester’s “To the Postboy”. The trauma discussed is related to the events that led up to Rochester’s poem. Richards also points out a notable spiritual agreement between Rochester and a friend, promising one another to meet each other in the afterlife, a promise that has repercussions on the way we view Rochester’s spiritual beliefs. 

####Eyers, Tom. "The Perils of the "Digital Humanities": New Positivisms and the Fate of Literary Theory." Postmodern Culture 23.2 (2013). Project MUSE. Web. 14 Feb. 2015.

Eyers illuminates “what an alternative, progressive trajectory in literary analysis might look like” (2). Appraises methodologies such as Franco Moretti’s use of distant reading and a reaction from Prendergast who largely agrees with Moretti’s views except for his refusal to go further in his argument once it has been reduced to purely consuming through a singular model. Dismisses deformative criticism as somewhat redundant, claiming it merely confirms what others have already said.

The part of this article that is most helpful for my argument with computers is Eyers discussion of Stephen Ramsay’s “Reading Machines” and his critical views of deformation as an analysis tool. Eyers remarks that deformation usually only confirms what critiques have already said, making it redundant. I completely disagree with this reading and would touch on this fact in my argument, that the very confirmation of what other critiques have been saying is evidence of deformance’s success as a critical approach. 

####Fisher, Nicholas. "'I Abhorr What I Soe Long Lov'd': An Exploration Of Rochester's 'Death Bed Repentance'." Seventeenth Century 25.2 (2010): 323-349. Art Source. Web. 5 Feb. 2015.

Fisher attempts to appraise whether Rochester’s deathbed conversion was sincere, analyzing contextual evidence and Rochester’s literary works. A principal claim is that Rochester’s religious decision stems from a search for a stability and truth that he never found in life.

This article is extremely integral to the argument I am making, it provides both evidence for and against Rochester’s sincerity in his deathbed conversion. It leads me to realize the substantial amount of religious moments that have often go unnoticed in Rochester’s life and I will integrate some of this evidence into my piece. 

####Gill, James E. "The Fragmented Self In Three Of Rochester's Poems." Modern Language Quarterly 49.1 (1988): 19. Professional Development Collection. Web. 5 Feb. 2015.

Gill claims that Rochester’s poems have two distinctly different sets of values and that “Rochester’s best poems ‘employ paradoxes’” (21), implementing conflicting subtexts. Claims that readers must understand both the historical context and the “intellectual context in which readers perform” (23).
	
The idea of “Fragmented Self” applies both to the speaker of the poem and the reader. This article will be used as a way of understanding readership and the contradictions that occur when presented with a poem by Rochester.

####Hoover, David L. "Text-Alteration As An Interpretive Teaching Strategy: The Case Of ‘The Snow Man.’" Style 42.4 (2008): 470-485. Academic Search Complete. Web. 14 Feb. 2015.
	
Hoover argues that text-alteration is one “of the best ways to understand how a texts works” (470). The article demonstrates how through altering a text you can show students the relationships between text, reader, and interpretation. Demonstrates that even minor changes to a poem have distinct interpretive repercussions. Hoover works through different forms of text-alteration that achieve various effects.

Hoover’s article demonstrates many uses of text-alteration that provide examples for me to base my own deformation on. The claim that to give an alteration purpose you must have an argument already in mind helps outline how I should be creating my rules for deformance.

####Mackie, Erin. "Boys Will be Boys: Masculinity, Criminality, and the Restoration Rake."The Eighteenth Century 46.2 (2005): 129-49. JSTOR. Web. 5 Feb. 2015.

Mackie discuses the origins of the rake figure, and postulates that it derives from “fantasies of masculinity” (130). Claims that the rake is a key figure associated with violence.

This article will be used as a part of my basis for creating my rules for deforming “To the Postboy”. The libertine rake as a figure and genre is something I will attempt to heighten in some of the deformed versions. Mackie digs into the persona of rakes and explains how they appear above the law and as Rochester describes a “peerless peer” (130).
	
####McGann, Jerome. "Dialogue and Interpretation at the Interface of Man and Machine: Reflections on Textuality and a Proposal for an Experiment in Machine Reading." Computers and the Humanities 36.1 (2002): 95-107. ProQuest. Web. 14 Feb. 2015.

McGann explores “new approaches to computerized text analysis” (95) identifying a need for texts to be in forms compatible with digital analysis. With a focus on works by Dante, McGann suggests that the notes Dante provides between many parts of his poems create a division that changes the poem itself. McGann goes on to discuss the significance of form and Laws of Form by G. Spencer Brown who states that every text “turns reflexively back upon itself” (103). Concluding that deforming texts leads to new areas of inquiry and inspires new questions for how we can use computers to learn sets of rules and apply them to a text.

McGann points out how Dante’s notes in his poetry creates a map that can provoke readers to search for meaning. My ‘map’ will be the changes I make to Rochester’s poem to provoke readers to ask questions, like they would with Dante’s notes, contemplating what these deviations do to the poem. Like McGann suggests, a text is a “reflection of and on itself, an analysis of itself” (99).

####Samuels, Lisa, and Jerome McGann. "Deformance and Interpretation." New Literary History 30.1, Poetry & Poetics (1999): 25-56. JSTOR. Web. 15 Feb. 2015.

Samuels and McGann discuss how to “release or expose the poem’s possibilities of meaning?” (28) and answer this question through deformation. Describes four types of deformative critique: reordered, isolating, altering and adding. Claims that when you change the poem it changes the way it functions and you can then see a different side of the piece, which can provoke new questions.

This article is the basis of my critical formula in arguing with computers. I am hoping to use all four of the deformative techniques and use that deformation to question why it does or does not work as a piece of Rochester’s poetry. Ultimately, trying to unravel how religious or libertine “To the Postboy” can become before it no longer bears a resemblance to a piece written by Rochester.

####Vanhaesebrouck, Karel and Dehert, Pol. "Introduction: Libertine Bodies or the Politics of Baroque Corporeality." Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies 12.2 (2012): 1-11. Project MUSE. Web. 5 Feb. 2015.

Vanhaesebrouck is calling for a return to the understanding of libertinism form the seventeenth and eighteenth century, “inherently experimental nature, its performative urgency that made individuals believe that they could rethink their world and their position as individuals within that world” (3). Using Rochester as his basis Vanhaesebrouck claims a libertine is both absorbed in the performative body and “is at the same time burlesque, pornographic, satirical, and political” (5).

My argument will incorporate Vanhaesebrouck’s discussion of the division and fluctuation in Rochester’s work, that he is constantly searching for answers and show this confliction in his writing, which is what I will demonstrate in “To the Postboy”.

Revised Thought Piece
######(Text in bold has been revised)

John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester, was never known for his spiritual or moral values. A sinner by trade, the majority of his poems left religion to the religious. However, in his poem “To The Postboy”, Rochester takes off his mask of drink and women and reveals a concern for his own mortality. With every line of the poem he slowly tears away at his libertine persona and exposes vulnerability and insecurity. It is speculated that Rochester converted to Christianity on his deathbed, but in reviewing this particular poem we see hints that perhaps religion was not a last minute choice for him, but instead a lengthier, more contemplated decision and this is something worthy of investigation. Through Rochester’s 
#####poem I will juxtapose a spectrum of versions using deformance to see a range from religious to libertine.
	
#####Through new media I will create different versions of the poem with systematic rules that I will develop. These rules will be based on comparisons and patterns seen in other poetry of the period (libertine and religious poetry). Patterns I might use include word choice, rhyme, style and form. I will attempt to identify which of the deformed poems would be most believable as a Rochester poem. I will also provide all of the poems I used to construct my deformation criteria. 

Some of the possible ingredients for my argument 
#####HTML
 Markdown. The idea of making my reading of a poem more accessible to a wider audience is what principally influenced my decision concerning format.

##Ashley's Reviews on Thought Pieces:

###1) Adam Kneeland
Make sure you have a direct idea of where your argument is going and keeping that point defined. Because you are interested in The Knight’s Tale, The Wife Bath and a few other tales you could focus on a few different tales making different points each. You can show how when the text escapes or shifts in meaning. It would be interesting to make the game into an applicable, interactive source, I think you should focus on the gaming aspect..
Create a game with an unstated argument and then give your blatant argument afterwards
Satisfy some kind of achievement, giving the user choices. 
Oculus rift has a horror game that is purely interaction based not points based.



###2) Danielle Morgan
You could give your projecting perspective, what you can see that is best described through image. Different readings, audio recordings, can be used to represent different perspectives. You can ask what is it like to be read to? You provide a monotone reading and then an audio of your individual interpretation represented through your voice. You could then encourage people to post their own audio recordings as well. You can see and hear a contrast and for kids it is exciting. 

Your design could be very key, you have to make some very specific and thought-out choices in the way you present your project. You could give your reader choices of perspective (dark, exciting, beautiful, etc…) and they will see the poem through that design perspective. Engulf the audience with the way a text can be read differently as you read.

With all the exciting design aspects be sure you also stick to your original argument and make the whole project well rounded leaving your audience thinking about your original thesis. 



###3) Katherine Goertz
Choose your own adventure could be an exciting framework. You can place your audience in different perspectives and dependent on those perspectives they will be given limited content on the situation
How would you get people to realize the alternate perspectives and see them?
Thinking about how all of history is written from a certain perspective. 
Different evidence from the same event leads users to different conclusions.
Moving all the events apart and then your interpretation may change of the text, taking away context.
Maybe have a room and all the events as objects in a room and as you click on various items you get little clues what the object is related to.
Allowing users to arrange a timeline could be another exciting attribute
Make sure you have a closing takeaway idea that you want people to have when they walk away and incorporate this idea the whole way through.

You could use a poll to see how people statistically people are perceiving or a forum for them to give thoughts. Assembling different perspectives from your audience would create a sense of community and reflection, however, I wouldn’t allow users to comment or see other’s comments until they are done using everything else you provide first.

Through Rochester as an individual and the libertine persona as a whole, I ask the question of whether it possible to be both religious and a libertine?
	
A possible route to further this question through new media could be searching for key terms in other principal works of Rochester that might illuminate some of his views on spirituality, accompanying the piece with either audio or video aids. Creating new links between new media and computation can help address this question in a new way through quantitative searching of terms, seeing patterns that normally would go unnoticed. New media also allows creation for user interaction, which can produce exciting arguments that can provide evidence in different forms such as audio and video. 
New media can help me develop speculations on larger quantities of literature through scanning through vast sums of material quickly, searching for key terms and patterns.

I would like to make the argument using a long form, media-rich narrative because it would allow me to accompany my reading of the poem with interactive elements, such as discussing the significance of the meter and rhyme through moving the users mouse to parts of the poem. 

Some of the possible ingredients for my argument are Scalar, CSS and Active Markdown. The idea of making my reading of a poem more accessible to a wider audience is what principally influenced my decision concerning format. Creating an interactive layout can be intriguing to less academic audiences who tend to become bored of reading the standard critical essay. I am interested in education and am always looking for ways to make younger people excited about literature and I believe an interactive format aids in achieving that.

## 20 January 2015:
I am convinced by Galloway’s observation that hermeneutic interpretation and imminent iridescence are beginning to fade in the shadow of the network, yet I disagree that they will ever completely disappear. The network has become a necessity because of the exponentially growing amount of information available. To properly assess information in a specific field the use of machines becomes an asset in organizing all of the applicable knowledge. I do however see a danger in relying too heavily on networks and losing the contextual intelligence that can be applied when using hermeneutics. Hermeneutics encourages alternative thinking that is outside the realm of standard vernacular reasoning and because of this it has the capability to provide concepts and ideas that a standard network may not have considered. Immanence is also a valuable form because it provides possibilities for the individual to respond viscerally, which can lead to an unhindered truth due to the thinker having no time to edit their reaction. 

Should Galloway’s claims occur, scholarship would likely continue in a direction of placing extreme value on accuracy and less on creativity. The arts in education are already met with skepticism due to the lack of definite “right” and “wrong” concepts. Having a solely network based society pushes the arts towards more unambiguous views, losing the independent immersive experience that makes literature what it is. 

Galloway seems to be lamenting that this is the direction society is moving. When Galloway closes his argument discussing Aphrodite as representing the individual who stays in the “middle” (67-8) he contemplates how each part of the body is essential to the whole, which is why I would argue that Galloway would not advocate for a completely networked world. Galloway appears to endorse a need for an efficient balance of hermeneutics, immanence and networks, not a singular dominant form.
